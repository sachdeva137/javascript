[9:40 PM, 8/5/2017] Akash Singh: 1) Using position properties try to create something similar as in image
2) Load a javascript file externally
3) Learn what is addEventListner - and using it add click event to all the divs. Just like background color, everyone should also have click event.
4) addEventListner takes a function when gets called everytime, someone clicks the div - in that function alert the id of div. Example, if div1 is clicked it should alert "div1".
5) Now click on different div's and what all is alerted.
Observe what is happening, and if there is something unexpected.
