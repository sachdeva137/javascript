#6
Normal object creation is a = {}
Now create the same by your custom function. 
Take few arguments, and return a object with predefined set of keys.

This function would be called your constructor function.
Since #6 is extremely simple, when you call the function, console.log "this" when you call this function. Remember this value because it will be used in #7.                        
create it by a.b notation and a["b"] notation.. both
