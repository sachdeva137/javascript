back to #1                        
is baar we will explore more tags.. but with elements which have ui                                        
select option textfield textarea button                        
Input                        
But there is something to learn here                        
i told before har element becomes object in js                                               
which you can get by getElementByid etc                        
To this is what you have to see                                                
Suppose select and option ka use karke i created combobox                        
to 2 type ki cheej                        
ek to ui se value bharo usmai                        
Then try to get it from js                        
Fir inverse behaviour                        
Ki value bharo using js                        
jaise option 2 select ki dropdown mai ui se.. to function mai pata karo ki which option is selected                        
fir doosre case mai.. js se hi option 2 select karo                        
isse tumko nayi properties pata chalengi                        
Aur ye bhi                        
Ki depending on type of tag js object mai properties can be different                        
hand code karna.. bhale hi net se dekh ke
